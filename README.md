| New Major Version Warning |
|----|

- This is the new major version of Liquid Application Framework, launched on April/2021.
- We've made significant breaking changes and a complete rearchitecture of our framework. So, this version isn't compatible and there is no easy conversion from the old one.
- We decided to deprecate the old version and it will not receive any kind of updates, not even bug fixes. But, for historical purposes and to allow anyone relying on it to fork the code and maintain its own version of it, we'll keep the [old repository](https://github.com/Avanade/Liquid-Application-Framework-1.0-deprecated) public.

## What is Liquid?

Liquid is a **multi-cloud** framework designed to **accelerate the development** of cloud-native microservices while avoiding coupling your code to specific cloud providers.

When writing Liquid applications, you stop worrying about the technology and focus on your business logic - Liquid abstracts most of the boilerplate and let you just write domain code that looks great and gets the job done.

## Feature

- Abstracts a number of services from cloud providers such as Azure, AWS and Google Cloud to enable you to write code that could run anywhere.
- Brings a directed programming model that will save you time on thinking how to structure your application, allowing you to focus on writing business code.

## Getting Started

To use Liquid, you create a new base ASP.Net Core application and then download and install the following nuget packages:

| Liquid Application Framework Binaries | Type | Version |
| :-- | :--: | :--: |
| [`Liquid.Core`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Liquid.Core) | **_mandatory_** | ![Nuget (with prereleases)](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/Liquid.Core) |
| [`Liquid.Domain`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Liquid.Domain) | **_desirable_** | ![Nuget (with prereleases)](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/Liquid.Domain) |
| [`Liquid.Repository`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Liquid.Repository) | **_optional_** | ![Nuget (with prereleases)](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/Liquid.Repository) |
| [`Liquid.Cache`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Liquid.Cache) | **_optional_** | ![Nuget (with prereleases)](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/Liquid.Cache) |
| [`Liquid.Messaging`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Liquid.Messaging) | **_optional_** | ![Nuget (with prereleases)](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/Liquid.Messaging) |
| [`Liquid.WebApi.Http`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Liquid.WebApi.Http) | **_optional_** | ![Nuget (with prereleases)](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/Liquid.WebApi.Http) |

And then choose the implementation cartridges you need to your project, for example:

- You can choose to expose an API using an HTTP endpoint (then install [`Liquid.WebApi.Http`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Liquid.WebApi.Http)) 
- You can choose to use MongoDB as your data repository (then install [`Liquid.Repository.MongoDB`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Liquid.Repository.MongoDB)) or to use  Entity Framework ([`Liquid.Repository.EntityFramework`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Liquid.Repository.EntityFramework))
- You can choose to use Azure ServiceBus as your messaging platform (then install [`Liquid.Messaging.Azure`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Liquid.Messaging.Azure)) or to use AWS SQS ([`Liquid.Messaging.Aws`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Liquid.Messaging.Aws))

## Liquid Templates  _`new`_

Now you can use Liquid Templates to get your microservice started faster!

To use it, just install the templates by running the following dotnet CLI command at the PowerShell prompt :

```Shell
dotnet new --install Liquid.Templates
```
and run dotnet new command with the name and parameters of the following templates:
|Name|Description|
| :-- | :-- |
|`liquidcrudsolution`       |Liquid WebAPI CRUD Solution (Domain and WebAPI projects)              |
|`liquidwebapisolution`     |Liquid WebAPI solution (Domain and WebAPI projects)                   |
|`liquidcrudextsolution`    |Liquid CRUD Extension solution (Domain and WebAPI projects)           |
|`liquidworkersolution`     |Liquid WorkerService solution (Domain and WorkerService projects)     |
|`liquiddomainaddhandler`   |Liquid mediator command handler                                       |
|`liquidcrudaddentity`      |Liquid entity class, CRUD mediator handlers and CRUD controller       |
|`liquidcrudextaddentity`   |Liquid CRUD Extension entity and controller classes                   |
|`liquidwebapiaddentity`    |Liquid entity class, mediator command handler and CRUD controller     |
|`liquidbcontextaddentity`  |Liquid DbContext entity configuration class (for Entity Framework)    |
|`liquiddbcontextproject`   |Liquid Repository project (EntityFramework DbContext configurations)  |
|`liquidwebapiproject`      |Liquid WebAPI project                                                 |
|`liquidworkerproject`      |Liquid WorkerService project                                          |
|`liquiddomainproject`      |Liquid Domain project (mediator command handler)                      |


### Sample:
To create an WebAPI solution with CRUD handlers, you must:
- execute command :
```Shell
dotnet new liquidcrudsolution --projectName "some root namespace" --entityName "some entity" --entityIdType "type of your unique ID"
```

- open the folder where the command was executed, and open the project created in the IDE of your choice:

![template_sample](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30960065/153954780-0ec8a6c0-153e-4bbc-8f3a-4ccc9c1e7858.png)

- follow the instructions found in the generated code TODOs, and run!

> You can make changes in code, add more classes and project if you need, and also using others Liquid templates to do it!
