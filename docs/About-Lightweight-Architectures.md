Successful modern digital solutions, like startups, while starts small and agile, had to cope with accelerated growth, reaching hundreds of millions of concurrent users while still being able to compete and evolve rapidly.

Hence, those companies (startups) have set the bar (of technology competence) to a much higher level than traditional enterprises were used to.

Now, a new set of styles, patterns and practices rules the modern application life-cycle, targeting enterprises that are in their way to digital transformation (and competition).

Such type of enterprise architecture is being so called lightweight, in the sense that it resembles the lightness of **"born-digital"** solutions when compared to what has been done in large traditional companies.
