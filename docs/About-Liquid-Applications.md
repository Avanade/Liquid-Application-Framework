Accenture uses the term [Liquid Applications](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/capability-rapid-application-development-studio) to emphasize the ever-changing aspect of a given solution, meant do deal with unpredictable yet presumable external pressure from users, clients, competitors and regulators.

Thus, for "liquid application", we should think about a custom business solution build on top of a [lightweight architecture](About-Lightweight-Architectures.md) and able to coexist and evolve in the digital environment.

Such kind of application should be developed using a cloud-first, mobile-first and API-first approach, using Agile & DevOps practices and tools.

Liquid have many [resources to ease the development and operation of such applications](Using-Liquid-for-building-your-application.md).
